* HOL to FOL. Do this in the verified checker. Introduce new etoms to represent instancecs of higher-order functions.
* When we matched against ``Eq`` in monomorphization, we found that some type arguments of other constants got unified with ``Prop``, which created a bunch of junk lemma. Find out whether something similar happened in Duper.
* Implement native interpretation and native proof reconstruction
* Improve portfolio mode script. Download E and zipperposition from the web.
* Use `zipWithIndex` instead of the reinvented one.
