# lean-auto
Experiments in automation for Lean

## Coding Style
* ``Array``/``List``: We only use ``Array``. Functions whose signature contains ``List`` should be declared as ``private``.
* IR: Logic-oriented IR can be found in ```TRanslation/ReifTerm.lean```, and Solver-oriented IR can be found in ```Auto/IR/..```. Each IR should be equipped with its ``TransM``.
* Translation: Translation code from ``A`` to ``B`` should be written in ```Translation/A2B.lean```

## Utilities
* Command ```#getExprAndApply [ <term> | <ident> ]```: Defined in ```ExprExtra.lean```. This command first elaborates the ```<term>``` into a lean ```Expr```, then applies function ```<ident>``` to ```Expr```. The constant ```ident``` must be already declared and be of type ```Expr → TermElabM Unit```
* Command ```#genMonadState <term>, #genMonadContext <term>```: Defined in ```MonadUtils.lean```. Refer to the comment at the beginning of ```MonadUtils.lean```.
* Command ```#fromMetaTactic [<ident>]```: Calls ```Tactic.liftMetaTactic``` on ```<ident>```. The constant ```<ident>``` must be already declared and be of type ```MVarId → MetaM (List MVarId)```
* Lexical Analyzer Generator: ```Parser/LeanLex.lean```. The frontend is not yet implemented. The backend can be found in ```NDFA.lean```.
